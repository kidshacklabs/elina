		<h2> Ways we can Help </h2>
			<p> Here are some ways we can help save our bees along with other pollenators! </p>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong> Plant! </strong> If you plant more flowers, there will be more pollen for bees to spread! </li>
				<li> <strong> Bees get thirsty! </strong> Leave out a small basin of water for them to drink out of. </li>
				<li> <strong> Don't use fertilizers! </strong> Fertilizers are harmful to the bees and other pollenators! </li>
				<li> <strong> Support! </strong> Support local beekeepers and bee protection organizations! </li>
				<li> <strong> Buy local! </strong> Buy raw honey from your local beekeepers! </li>
				<li> <strong> Don't get rid of dandelions or other weeds! </strong> They are a great source of food for the bees. Plus, it helps more native species such as wild strawberries, trout lilies, and blue violets grow! </li>
				<li> <strong> Educate! </strong> Educating others about the important of bees is important! Most people view bees as scary monsters, when in reality they're harmless! </li>
				<li> <strong> Sign! </strong> Sign petitions to help protect the bees on websites such as <a href = "https://www.change.org/" target = "_blank"> change.org. </a> </li>
				<li> <strong> Join! </strong> Join the <a href = "https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmental-grants-incentives/pollinateto-community-grants/" target = "_blank"> PollinateTO </a> program, a program which offers $5000 to the people who create the best pollenator-friendly gardens! </li>
				<li> <strong> Speak up! </strong> Do what Sandy did! Take a trip to your city hall and demand a change! </li>
				<li> <strong> Each season! </strong> Make sure at least one plant in your garden is blooming every season! </li>
				<li> <strong> Mulch-free! </strong> Don't use mulch! </li>
				<li> <strong> Get Messy! </strong> Gardens that are too tidy aren't friendly to wildlife, so leave some messy patches that bees and other animals will use to construct nests! </li>
				<li> <strong> Check! </strong> Make sure that you are buying organic seeds! You wouldn't want to accidentally use insecticides like Sandy was! </li> 
			</ul>

		<h2> Fun Facts About Bees! </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Bees have five eyes! </li>
				<li> Bees have two stomachs, one is used for their food and </li>
				<li> A queen bee lives for 1-5 years while a worker bee lives for 30 days. </li>
				<li> Bees rarely sting people and animals, because if they do then they die. </li>
				<li> Bees are vegetarians unlike wasps, which are carnivores. </li>
				<li> About one third of what we eat relies on the pollenation of bees (things like fruits, vegetables, ant nuts) </li>
			</ul>
